1. Everything from base class is inherited in derived class
2. private of base class will be private of derived class with restrictions
    public of base will be public of dervied
    protected of base will be protected of derived
    default of base will be default of derived

Constructors are always called from base to derived.

You tell java which constructor of base class to be called,
else java will use the base class default constructor.

using super we can inform java about which constructor of base class to execute.
if you are using super to trigger a different constructor of base class then super must be
ths first statement in derived class constructor.
